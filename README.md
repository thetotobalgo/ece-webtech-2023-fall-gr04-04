## Miscellaneous

- Most of the commits are by moonwalkeuse, this is on Tom's VS Code, we don't know why but each time we commited, even if we changed github account, it commited using this username. We gave you screenshot in the public repo to proove that this is us. Each time that we pushed using this computer, it is someone else account, we know this seems sketchy but we can prove it to you. You can also check using fork, the account who pushed is either thetotobalgo, totobalgo or baksaad.

### Course Feedback

The best thing about this course is the wide range of skills it covers, from UX design and development to project management, giving us a comprehensive understanding of the web development process. 
The entire group has responded well to the web technology course, which provides an engaging and enriching learning environment.
The potential for skill reinforcement presented by the technical challenge of using only Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS was great. 
Furthermore, the focus on professional development techniquesâ€”like documentation, efficient use of Git, and project structure was instructive. 
Overall, the course found a good balance between theory and practical application. 
Adding more practical workshops to reinforce course topics is the only suggestions for improvement me can make.


### Project Reuse

- [x] We authorize the professors to use our project as an example for the next year students (facultative).
